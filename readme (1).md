# Urban Mobility Patterns Analysis

**Final Project â€“ Big Data**  
*Bachelor in Digital Technologies, AI & Decision Support Systems*

This project analyzes urban mobility patterns using **MongoDB** and **PySpark**. It collects, cleans, and processes datasets (traffic, public transport, shared bikes) to identify congestion hotspots, usage patterns, and correlations between variables like weather and traffic volume.

## Features
- Batch and advanced data processing with PySpark  
- Data storage and querying with MongoDB  
- Exploratory and advanced analysis of urban mobility trends  
- Visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn  
- Automated reports generation  

## Tech Stack
- MongoDB  
- PySpark  
- Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas)  

## How to Run
1. Start MongoDB and import datasets.  
2. Install Python dependencies.  
3. Run scripts in `/scripts` for data processing and analysis.  
4. Explore notebooks in `/notebooks` for visualizations and insights.
